    "> - Source with a link\n",
    "\n",
    "https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ebola-cases-2014\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Country: Name of the affected country\n",
    "Cases: Number of reported Ebola cases\n",
    "Deaths: Number of reported Ebola deaths\n",
    "Date: Reporting period or cumulative totals\n",

    "### Data set selection rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why did you select this data set?\n",
    "\n",
    "I selected this dataset because I wanted to explore a topic related to healthcare, as I am particularly interested in understanding public health statistics. The Ebola dataset provides meaningful insights into cases and deaths across affected countries, allowing me to analyze patterns, compare regions, and visualize the impact of the outbreak. This makes it a strong choice for applying statistical analysis and data visualization techniques while connecting to my interest in healthcare data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using statistical analysis and visualization, what questions would you like to be able answer about this dataset.\n",
    "> This could include questions such as:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between X and Y variables?\n",
    "> - What is the distribution of the variables?\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between the variables and the target?\n",
    ">   You will need to frame these questions in a way to show value to a stakeholder (i.e.why should we know about the relationship between X and Y variables?)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the distribution of Ebola cases and deaths across affected countries? Stakholder Value: Helps public health officials identify which countries were most severely impacted, guiding resource allocation and preparedness for future outbreaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the relationship between reported cases and deaths (i.e., case fatality rate) across countries? Stakeholder Value: Provides insight into healthcare system effectiveness and disease severity in different regions. High CFRs may indicate limited access to treatment or delayed interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How did the number of cases and deaths change over time in each country? Stakeholder Value: Shows outbreak progression, helping stakeholders understand when interventions were most needed and whether they were effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How do different regions (e.g., West Africa countries) compare in terms of outbreak severity and fatality rates? \n",
    "\n",
    "5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "> Provide a few examples of what you plan to visualize to answer the questions you posed in the previous section. In this project, you will be producing 6-8 visualizations. You will also be producing an interactive chart using Plotly.\n",
    "> Think about what those visualization could be: what are the variables used in the charts? what insights do you hope to gain from them?\n"
